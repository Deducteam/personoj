= Translating PVS to Dedukti with Personoj =
Gabriel Hondet

_Personoj_ is a suite of tools to translate specifications from
the higher order, highly automated proof assistant
link:http://pvs.csl.sri.com[PVS] to the universal type checker
link:https://deducteam.github.io[Dedukti].

Translating PVS to Dedukti serves mainly two purposes. The first is to
port PVS developments to other proof assistants, so that users of say,
link:https://coq.inria.fr[Coq], could use in their work theorems or
specifications done in PVS. The second is to cross-check PVS
specifications and proofs with an independent checker in order to
increase our trust in these proofs and specifications.

This work is part of a larger project led by the
link:https://deducteam.gitlabpages.inria.fr[Deducteam] made of
link:http://www.lsv.fr/~dowek/Publi/logipedia.pdf[Logipedia] and
link:https://github.com/Deducteam/nubo[Nubo].

== Translating theoretically ==

Translating PVS into Dedukti requires to be able to express a
sufficiently large subset of the theory of PVS into the 
link:http://www.lsv.fr/~dowek/Publi/expressing.pdf[λΠ-calculus modulo
theory]. Such a task is usually not easy. In the case of PVS,
defining the logic of PVS is already tricky, but its core has been
formally studied in
link:https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01673518[F. Gilbert PhD
thesis]. In particular, two languages has been defined. The first
named _PVS-Core_ is the language in which PVS specifications are
written in. It is based on Simple Type Theory with implicit predicate
subtyping, ad-hoc polymorphism and some sort of prenex polymorphism
and dependent types.  In particular, this language does not contain
proof terms and type checking a term is not decidable. The second
language named _PVS-Cert_ is a language for PVS-Core certificates. It
replaces implicit predicate subtyping of PVS-Core with explicit
predicate subtyping. This allows terms to contain proof terms and type
checking terms becomes decidable.

PVS-Cert has been encoded in
link:https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdpi[lambdapi], an extension of
Dedukti with meta-variables. This encoding is described
link:https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03279766[there].
The encoding of PVS-Core is work in progress. In particular, encoding
implicit predicate subtyping requires some procedure to make it
explicit. Personoj provides the encodings that can be used by lambdapi
(in its development version) to explicit PVS-Core specifications and
type check them.

== How to translate and X-check PVS files? ==

We call translation of a PVS file the process of creating a file in
the syntax of lambdapi (suffixed by +.lp+) from a PVS specification
(suffixed by +.pvs+). Cross-checking a PVS file consists in type
checking its translation.

IMPORTANT: this document is focused on the translation of the standard
library of PVS called _Prelude_. Its management is a bit particular
because it is somewhat linked to the lisp code of PVS. Some steps
shouldn't be necessary when translating other libraries such as NASA's
link:https://github.com/nasa/pvslib[pvslib].

TIP: Looking at the scripts used by the continuous integration may
help with the installation and translation.

NOTE: If not stated otherwise, all paths are relative to the root of
the local clone of personoj (if the paths are not absolute). This path
is also assumed to be stored in the environment variable
+$PERSONOJPATH+.

=== Requirements ===

* link:https://pvs.csl.sri.com/downloads.html[PVS 7.1]
* link:https://github.com/gabrielhdt/lambdapi[lambdapi], branch
  +refiner_why3quant+
* BSD flavoured +make+

CAUTION: BSD makefiles are used rather than GNU makefiles. Linux users
may have to use +bmake+ rather than +make+.

=== Installing PVS ===

Refer to the instructions of the download page. We assume that +PVSPATH+
is the path to the directory where PVS has been extracted (such that
+PVSPATH/pvs+ is a valid executable file).

[TIP]
--
PVS can be loaded into any SBCL session (unless the running SBCL is
not the same as the one PVS has been compiled with) using
[source,lisp]
include::../tools/load-pvs.lisp[]
--

=== Installing lambdapi ===

The easiest way is to use the link:https://opam.ocaml.org[opam]
(version 2.0 or later):
[source,sh]
opam pin add 'git://github.com/gabrielhdt/lambdapi#refiner_why3quant'

[NOTE]
--
A local OPAM switch with all dependencies installed can be set up
with (can be called at the root of personoj) 
[source,sh]
opam switch create .
--

[NOTE]
--
If the compilation of lambdapi fails, opam may force the exact version
of all dependencies with the +--locked+ option. The downside is that is
also forces the version of ocaml and may require changing the switch.
--

=== Install and setup of personoj ===

The encoding can be install with (BSD) make,
[source,sh]
cd encoding && make install

The exporter must be loaded by PVS upon startup. 
For this, add the following to +~/.pvs.lisp+

[source,lisp]
include::../tools/load-personoj.lisp[]
(load-personoj)

TIP: +load-personoj+ can be called with a parameter which supersedes
the variable +$PERSONOJPATH+.

=== Translating the Prelude ===

[source,sh]
cd prelude && make

will create a set of empty +.lp+ files and translate and type check
other files. The (nearly) empty files stand for theories that can't be
translated yet.

TIP: if the translation fails, ensure that +$PVSPATH+ and
+$PERSONOJPATH+ are correctly set up.

== Xchecking PVS proofs

PVS files do not contain proof terms. One of the consequences is that
proofs are not reprensented as lambda terms and thus verifying a proof
does not consist in checking that the type of the term is the proposition
that it proves. A proof is recorded as a sequence of tactics
footnote:[The list of tactics is available
link:http://pvs.csl.sri.com/doc/pvs-prover-guide.pdf[here]]
that are replayed.

Because LPMT relies on the Curry-Howard principle, that a proof is a
term whose type is the type of the proposition it proves, PVS proofs
must be transformed. PVS tactic sequences are too fragile and too much
implementation dependant to be processed. We rather use the proveit program
to replay the proofs in PVS and print all the sequents of the proof in
a trace file.

The PVS patch +proof-hooks.lisp+ makes proveit to output traces that can
be processed by the program in +psnj_toolbox+. The patch +proveit.lisp+
allows proveit to operate correctly on the PVS prelude (otherwise proveit
does nothing when called on the prelude).

[CAUTION]
--
link:http://pvs.csl.sri.com/license.html?tgzfile=pvs7.1.0-ix86_64-Linux-allegro.tgz[Allegro PVS]
must be used to produce traces. Traces may be produced with
+proveit --traces -l <path/to/file.pvs>+.
--

In particular, the ocaml package provides a +psnj+ binary with a command
+pipe+ that transforms a PVS file into a type checked lambdapi file.
To do this, the following operations are carried out:

. sequents are extracted as propositions from the traces along with
  their position in the proof tree;
. these propositions are transformed into implications such that the premises
  imply the conclusion (premises and conclusions are defined by the
  positions in the proof tree);
. propositions are rewritten into a weaker logic (namely Simple Type
  Theory with logical connectives);
. each inference step is proved through a call to the tactic `why3;`
  that calls external solvers.
