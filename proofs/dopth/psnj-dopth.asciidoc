== NAME

psnj-dopth - Build a Makefile dependency list from paths

== SYNOPSIS

psnj-dopth

== DESCRIPTION

*psnj-dopth* is a filter that transform a newline-separated list
of strings and paths into a Makefile dependency list. A path is a
dot-separated list of integers (such as 0.1.1) or the word *root*. A
string _s1_ depends on a string _s2_ if the path of _s1_ is a successor
of the path of _s2_.  A path _p_ is a successor of _q_ if _p_ = _q_.i
where _i_ is an integer.

== EXIT STATUS

*psnj-dopth* exits with 0 on success, and something else on failure.
