== NAME

dopth - Write dependencies between strings based on their path

== SYNOPSIS

	dopth

== DESCRIPTION

+dopth+ prints a dependency list on its standard output (in the
Makefile format) using data passed to its standard input. The data
consists of newline separated pairs of strings and paths, where a path
is a dot-separated list of integers or +root+, such as +0.1.2+. A string
+s1+ depends on a string +s2+ if the path +p+ of +s1+ is a successor
of the path +q+ of +s2+.  A path _p_ is a successor of _q_ if _p = q.i_
where _i_ is an integer.

== EXIT STATUS

+dopth+ exits with 0 on success, and something else on failure.
